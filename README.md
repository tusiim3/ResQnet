# Smart Arduino Helmet

Smart Arduino Helmet is an embedded system designed to improve motorcycle rider safety by reducing response times in case of emergencies. It combines sensors and microcontrollers to detect helmet usage, monitor rider conditions, and trigger smart alerts. Collected data is sent to a companion mobile app, providing real-time notifications, accident alerts, and analytics for both riders and emergency contacts.

## Features

- **Helmet Detection:** Ensures the helmet is worn before the motorcycle can be operated.
- **Rider Monitoring:** Tracks rider conditions and sends alerts in case of abnormal situations or accidents.
- **Mobile App Integration:** Pairs with a mobile app for real-time notifications, data visualization, and alert management.
- **IoT & Wireless Connectivity:** Communicates data wirelessly for live monitoring and analytics.
- **Accident Alerts:** Automatically notifies emergency contacts or services via the mobile app in the event of an accident.

## Technologies Used

- C/C++ for embedded development
- Microcontroller (Arduino)
- Sensors (accelerometer & gyroscope)
- SIM800L GSM module for wireless communication
- Mobile app 
- IoT protocols

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tusiim3/Smart-Arduino-Helmet.git
   ```
2. **Set up your hardware:**
   - Assemble the smart helmet with the required sensors and microcontroller.
   - Connect components according to the provided circuit diagrams.

3. **Build and flash the firmware:**
   - Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Arduino IDE, PlatformIO).
   - Adjust configuration files as needed.
   - Upload the firmware to your microcontroller.

4. **Pair with the mobile app:**
   - Download and install the ResQnet App on your phone.
   - Follow the setup instructions in the app README to connect to your helmet.

5. **Test the system:**
   - Power on the hardware and verify the app receives notifications and data from the backend.
   - Test helmet detection, data transmission, and alerting features.
